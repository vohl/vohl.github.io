title: Last minute post for the First week
---

Well here we go for the last semester of my college experience.This is not my first rodeo in a Downing course as I have taken Generics back when they were offering it, and now I am double-downing(my slang for attacking two of his courses at the same time), and am looking forward to a not so grueling semester while learning practical and applicable software engineering skills outside of just coding. The first week has served as a refresher into our core languages that we use in both course: C++ for OOP, and Python for SWE. I've been setting up my environments for all of my classes and purchasing all of the textbooks I need for such classes, this past week. For next week, I am planning on sitting down and churning out the Collatz project for both classes. Career fair is the next thing on my list, so I plan on focusing on it when it comes along, as being gainfully employed is a necessary part of life. 

#Object-Oriented Programming
----------------------------
OOP this week served as a means to help understand the development cycle that we will follow throughout our projects in the course. I think I could commit more often through git, as to see my actual progress in the project, while utilizing it to save my work. I've actually done some of these projects in my last Downing course, and am planning to start fresh to come up with new ideas to solve the same problems. I understand that some of my old code was probably quite ugly, so I want to write more mature code, and then possibly compare so that I can see how much two years of schooling can do to style. 

#Software Engineering 
---------------------
SWE helped remind me of the nuances of the typeless system that Python is, and I enjoyed the fact that the duck metaphor has not become deprecated. Again, the first project is the same one as his OOP project, but coded in a different language, so I can take my time on making my solutions efficient and beautiful. The first project is a trivial coding assignment stuffed with extras that will be used to help you develop you into a better programmer. The thing to take from this week would be the development cycle that he explained; where you construct a run harness that holds the structure of your algorithm, and a testing harness that is used to test your code.
 
#The Feelz
----------
Taking a Downing course again, I am reminded of the sublties of sitting in on his lectures. His style of lecture is extremely involved, which helps to keep the energy of the class up. He randomly selects a student to engage in a back and forth discussion over a segment of the code, and then pushes the students to answer the questions in the correct order so that the student can better learn. As for the quizes, I find the questions more of a test of whether or not you were mentally present during the last lecture, rather than evolving off of previous knowledge. So pay attention in the class, and cover the examples he went over the hour before and you should be good. I do appreciate the hints that he'll place in the quizzes leading to ways to optimize the code that we are currently working on.

* What did I do this past week?
  -set up environments and get books bought
* What's in your way?
  -nothing, really, as to next week I believe I can knockout the projects, since the two courses have the same projects, just in different languages.
* What will I do next week?
  -focus on career fair
