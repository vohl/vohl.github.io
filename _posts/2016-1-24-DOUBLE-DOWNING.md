title: Last minute post for the First week
---

Well here we go for the last semester of my college experience.This is not my first rodeo in a Downing course, and now I am double-downing, and am looking forward to a not so grueling semester while learning practical and applicable software engineering skills outside of just coding. The first week has served as a refresher into our core languages that we use in both course: C++ for OOP, and Python for SWE. I've been setting up my environments for all of my classes and purchasing all of the textbooks I need for such classes, this past week, and for next week, I am planning on sitting down and churning out the first couple projects for both classes. Career fair is coming up, so I plan on focusing on it when it comes along, as being gainfully employed is a necessary part of life. 

  OOP served as a means to help understand the development cycle this week. I think I could commit more, as to see my actual progress in the project, while utilizing git to save my work. I've actually done some of these projects in my last Downing course, and am planning to start fresh to come up with new ideas to solve the same problems. I understand that some of my old code was probably quite ugly, so I want to write more mature code, and then possibly compare so that I can see how much two years of schooling can do to style. 
  
  SWE helped remind me of the nuances of the typeless system that Python is, and I enjoyed the fact that the duck metaphor has not become deprecated. Again, these projects are projects that I have done before in a different language, so I can take my time on making my solutions efficient and beautiful.  
  
  Taking a Downing course again, I am reminded of the sublties of sitting in on his lectures. His style of lecture is extremely involved, which helps to keep the energy of the class up. He forms a specific order of students with which he picks, and thenn pushes the students to answer the questions in the correct order so that the student can better learn. I find the questions more of a test of whether or not you were mentally present during the last lecture, rather than evolving off of previous knowledge. I do appreciate the hints of the quizzes leading to ways to optimize the code that we are currently working on. 
  
  -set up environments and get books bought
  -nothing, really, as to next week I believe I can knockout the projects, since the two courses have the same projects, just in different languages.
  -focus on career fair
