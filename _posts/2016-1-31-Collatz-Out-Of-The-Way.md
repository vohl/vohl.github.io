title: Collatz Out Of The Way
---

* What did I do this past week?
  -Got the Collatz project for SWE and OOP out of the way, and practiced some interview questions from Cracking the Coding Interview.
* What's in your way?
  -Nothing at the moment is in my way. 
* What will I do next week?
  -Practice the classical guitar(nothing at all cs related just something I've been learning because music is bae), and start working on an android utility app that will function as a tuner and a metronome.

#SWE and OOP
------------
There wasn't much of a distinction between the two classes for the second week as we covered the same topic, but in two different languages. Once again the quizzes introduced us to another optimization that we could add to our project to make it run faster, and it was made apparent that readings will be a heavy topic on the quizzes. Even if the quizzes and the random roll call wasn't there to convince a student to attend class, I feel like most students would be persuaded by the level of detail that he covers the material and picks it apart.

#The Feelz
----------
With the second week done and the first project out of the way I have to remind my self to stay diligent with regards to these classes because I know the work load will ramp up. The second week of class has yet to introduce anything new, but that doesn't mean someone should slack off during these early class days. Downing's lecture still hold plenty of value to them, as they explain the proper means of utilizing exceptions versus asserts in your projects. Something that I know I have taken for granted in college career. I walked out of class with further appreciation of the exception handlers in languages, and how they allow the error to trickle down to the level of the software where it can be handled.

#Tip-of-the-Week
For you python users out there, I was introduced to an interesting python programming concept called decorators. I stumbled upon this functional programming concept when I was looking at different ways to design a cache or utilize memoization on my function that computed the cycle length. What a decorator is, is a callable Python object that can be used to modify functions. The function is passed into the decorator as an argument and it returns the modified function. For my case, the decorator wrapped around my cycle length function and only called it when the computed value wasn't in the cache. This managed to keep the implementation elegant looking instead of muddy. "You don't look excited, you should be EXCITED! This is the high point of my blog!"
